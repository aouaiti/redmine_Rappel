## Configuration

   - Check "Rappel" to enable the plugin

2. **Choose your scheduling method**
   - **Option 1: ActiveJob** (runs automatically every minute)
     - No additional setup required
     - Works out of the box when Redmine is running
   
   - **Option 2: Cron job** (recommended for production)
     ```
     # Add to crontab (runs every 5 minutes)
     */5 * * * * cd /path/to/redmine && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake rappel:send_rappels
     ```

## Usage

1. **Creating reminders**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Click "Rappels" in the project menu
   - Click "New Rappel"
   - Fill in the details:
     - Subject: The email subject (you can use {{issue}} for the issue subject, {{id}} for issue ID)
     - Message: Optional message to include in the email
     - Issue: Select the issue to send reminders for
     - Frequency: Set how often to send the reminder
